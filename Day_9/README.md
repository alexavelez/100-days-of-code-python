# Day 9 of 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge: Silent Auction 🏆💰
Today, we built a Silent Auction program using Python dictionaries. In this program, guests can place bids on items, and the screen is cleared after every bid to keep the values concealed from other participants.

## Main File
In the main.py file, you'll find my solution, which handles cases where more than one person bids the highest amount. The program ensures fairness by considering all participants with the highest bid.

## Alternative Solutions
max() Function Solution: This alternative solution uses Python’s built-in max() function in a dictionary to determine the highest bid, offering a more concise approach than a loop.
Provided Solution: You’ll also find the solution in the instructional video for comparison.
